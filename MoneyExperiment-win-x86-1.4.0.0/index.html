        </li>

        <li>

            match your repo and credentials you used to make it, for example: git config user.name "Krasen Ivanov"

    <h3 id="howtouse">How to use:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>
            After starting, the app will ask you to set a password. Remember this. It's used to encrypt your database.
            If you forget your password you will have to delete the Database folder containing all of the entries. <br>
        </li>

        <li>
            After that, it will ask you to set a name and amount of the budget. For example: name - Monthly Budget,
            amount - 1000, or Wedding Expenses 12500.
        </li>

        <li>The menu will appear. Use "y" to add entries. Enter how much you spent and on what.</li>

        <li>
            You can add new items and if you add the same item their balance will increase automatically. Use
            <strong>-amount</strong> to decrease costs of already added item.
        </li>

        <li>
            You can change the name of the budget and amount in the other options menu, also you can create and delete
            new budgets, export the database to readable txt file, or import a budget.csv with "item, cost" format for
            example: "food, 50".
        </li>

        <li>
            When you are done you can save your current account database on your PC, and/or you can upload it to your
            git repo.
        </li>

        <li>
            If you want to use the app on another PC, install git and run CloneDB.bat after you set your git repo in the
            file as explained above. It should automatically sync your database. Remember to use the same password or
            you will not be able to open the encrypted database.
        </li>
    </ul>
